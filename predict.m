function p = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label of an input given a trained neural network
%   p = PREDICT(Theta1, Theta2, X) outputs the predicted label of X given the
%   trained weights of a neural network (Theta1, Theta2)

% Useful values
m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(Theta2, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned neural network. You should set p to a 
%               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
%
% Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
%       function can also return the index of the max element, for more
%       information see 'help max'. If your examples are in rows, then, you
%       can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.

a1 = [ones(m,1) X];
z2 = a1 *Theta1';
a2 = [ones(size(z2),1) sigmoid(z2)];
z3 = a2*Theta2';
a3 = sigmoid(z3);

[predict_max, index_max] = max(a3, [], 2);
p = index_max;




=======
function p = predict(theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic 
%regression parameters theta
%   p = PREDICT(theta, X) computes the predictions for X using a 
%   threshold at 0.5 (i.e., if sigmoid(theta'*x) >= 0.5, predict 1)

m = size(X, 1); % Number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly
p = zeros(m, 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned logistic regression parameters. 
%               You should set p to a vector of 0's and 1's
